Throughout this course we have learned many methods to ensure your programs functionality. The entirety of the testing process, from diagramming to testing preceding deployment, all make sure that your propgrams functionality and requiremtns are met. 
Testing throughout the development process allows the opportunity for more coverage and also makes it easier to address issues as they arise. I also feel that testing throughout the development process makes it easier to meet users needs, in so far as 
you are able to simplify things while they are still being developed and make things more user friendly and easier to use (think changing something to meet user needs before integration testing - it is obviously easier to address while it is still it's 
own unit and not complicated by other components of the software). This helps us to inform our approach to software design as a whole. Starting with the basics (ex- meeting customer requirements) and then building upon that and testing along the way allows 
for more effective and efficient software design, and also makes it easier for the developer to consider the user experience and improve upon it/make it more intuitive.
